    - path: "components/ui/"
      instructions: |
        ✅ Use for atomic, stateless design system primitives only (e.g., Button, Input, Card).
        ✅ Style with Tailwind utility classes or design tokens only.
        ❌ Do not fetch data or include context/state logic.
        ❌ Do not use feature-specific props or business logic.
        ---
        ✅ Use only the typography utility classes defined in `globals.css` (e.g., `heading-*`, `copy-*`, `button-*`, `label-*`) for type scale, weight, tracking and line-height.
        ❌ Do not use Tailwind's built-in typography sizing/weight/spacing utilities such as preset scales (`text-xs` … `text-9xl`), arbitrary sizes (`text-[...]`), `font-*`, `leading-*`, or `tracking-*` directly.
        ✅ Colour utilities (e.g., `text-foreground`, `text-muted-foreground`) remain allowed.

    - path: "shared/ui/"

        ✅ Use for reusable presentational components that are composed from primitives.
        ✅ May include layout awareness or context (e.g., responsive, theme).

    - path: "features/"
      instructions: |
        ✅ Use for domain-specific logic and components (e.g., Auth, Billing).
        ✅ May include feature-specific hooks, actions, and schema validation.
        ✅ Can use Supabase, APIs, or database logic.
        ❌ Do not put shared/global components here.

    - path: "components/widgets/"
      instructions: |
        ✅ Use for layout/page-specific component compositions (e.g., Navbar, HeroSection).
