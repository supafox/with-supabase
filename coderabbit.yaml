  path_instructions:
    - path: "components/ui/"
      instructions: |
        ✅ Use for atomic, stateless design system primitives only (e.g., Button, Input, Card).
        ✅ Style with Tailwind utility classes or design tokens only.
        ❌ Do not fetch data or include context/state logic.
        ❌ Do not use feature-specific props or business logic.

    - path: "shared/ui/"
      instructions: |
        ✅ Use for reusable presentational components that are composed from primitives.
        ✅ May include layout awareness or context (e.g., responsive, theme).
        ❌ Do not include API calls, server actions, or side effects.
        ---
        ✅ Use only the typography utility classes defined in `globals.css` (e.g., `heading-*`, `copy-*`, `button-*`, `label-*`) for type scale, weight, tracking and line-height.
        ❌ Do not use Tailwind's built-in typography sizing/weight/spacing utilities such as preset scales (`text-xs` … `text-9xl`), arbitrary sizes (`text-[...]`), `font-*`, `leading-*`, or `tracking-*` directly.
        ✅ Colour utilities (e.g., `text-foreground`, `text-muted-foreground`) remain allowed.

    - path: "features/"
      instructions: |
        ✅ Use for domain-specific logic and components (e.g., Auth, Billing).
        ✅ May include feature-specific hooks, actions, and schema validation.
        ✅ Can use Supabase, APIs, or database logic.
        ❌ Do not put shared/global components here.

    - path: "components/widgets/"
      instructions: |
        ✅ Use for layout/page-specific component compositions (e.g., Navbar, HeroSection).
        ✅ Can compose shared UI, features, and include state handlers.
        ❌ Do not reuse these components in other routes or features.

    - path: "shared/hooks/"
      instructions: |
        ✅ Use for global, cross-feature utility hooks.
        ❌ Do not include feature-specific/business logic here.
        ✅ Local state within generic, cross-cutting hooks is allowed; avoid feature-coupled side effects and data fetching.

    - path: "lib/"
      instructions: |
        ✅ Use for shared utilities, API clients, database setup, or helper functions.
        ❌ Do not include UI components or page-level logic.

    - path: "constants/"
      instructions: |
        ✅ Use for design tokens, route maps, SEO defaults, or static config.
        ❌ Do not include application logic or component code.

    - path: "styles/"
      instructions: |
        ✅ Use for global Tailwind layers and MDX-specific styles.
        ❌ Do not add component-scoped styles here.
